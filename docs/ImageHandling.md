# Image Handling

## Image Segmentation
1. ADE20K - pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. 
    Algorithms which can be used on this dataset include:
    - [FCN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038)
    - Mask R-CNN - Prefer this one
    - PSP Net

## Image Classification
1. COCO - Will use a pretrained model on some other dataset (Transfer Learning)
2. Open Images
3. SUN397 - Need to research on this dataset
